# Easy-RSA 3 parameter settings

# NOTE: If you installed Easy-RSA from your package manager, do not edit
# this file in place -- instead, you should copy the entire easy-rsa directory
# to another location so future upgrades do not wipe out your changes.

# HOW TO USE THIS FILE
#
# vars.example contains built-in examples to Easy-RSA settings. You MUST name
# this file "vars" if you want it to be used as a configuration file. If you
# do not, it WILL NOT be automatically read when you call easyrsa commands.
#
# It is not necessary to use this config file unless you wish to change
# operational defaults. These defaults should be fine for many uses without
# the need to copy and edit the "vars" file.
#
# All of the editable settings are shown commented and start with the command
# "set_var" -- this means any set_var command that is uncommented has been
# modified by the user. If you are happy with a default, there is no need to
# define the value to its default.

# NOTES FOR WINDOWS USERS
#
# Paths for Windows  *MUST* use forward slashes, or optionally double-escaped
# backslashes (single forward slashes are recommended.) This means your path
# to the openssl binary might look like this:
# "C:/Program Files/OpenSSL-Win32/bin/openssl.exe"

# A little housekeeping: DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION
#
# Easy-RSA 3.x does not source into the environment directly.
# Complain if a user tries to do this:
if [ -z "$EASYRSA_CALLER" ]; then
  echo "You appear to be sourcing an Easy-RSA *vars* file. This is" >&2
  echo "no longer necessary and is disallowed. See the section called" >&2
  echo "*How to use this file* near the top comments for more details." >&2
